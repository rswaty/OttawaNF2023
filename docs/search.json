These products also include ecosystem dynamic models that can be used for conservation, fire planning, and land management decisions.\nLANDFIRE’s mission is to provide agency leaders and managers with a common “all-lands” data set of vegetation and wildland fire/fuels information for strategic fire and resource management planning and analysis.\n\n “Advancing conservation outcomes through collaborative ecosystem science”"

However, due to harvests, fire suppression and other management actions (in addition to changes in natural processes) there have been some notable changes in succession classes (see “Succession classes for most dominant Biophysical Settings”) section below:\nPerhaps the most interesting broad-scale change is conversion of ‘conifer’ types to ‘hardwood’, presumably due to fire suppression. Some ecosystems have sizable over/under-representation of succession classes on the landscape today compared to modeled historic. For example:\n\nThere is a substantial ‘over-representation’ of succession class D in the Boreal Acid Peatland.\nLANDFIRE mapped almost total lack of succession classes A, B and C with the Boreal White Spruce-Fir-Hardwood-Inland ecosystem.\nAs is seen in most northern hardwood forests the late-closed succession class D was dominant historically, and way under-represented on the landscape today.\n\nThese differences may or may not be ‘real’ on the ground and/or may not be a management priority."
